# API Base URL – used for all API calls (auth, clients, email config, scheduled emails, etc.)
# Development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Production – set this to your real API host (e.g. Vercel/backend URL). Do NOT use localhost or 0.0.0.0 in production.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Optional: some setups use NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL as well – keep in sync with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL if used
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
